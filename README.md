# JScript Panel

The final release of this component can be downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/marc2k3/foo_jscript_panel/releases) page. The [wiki](https://github.com/marc2k3/foo_jscript_panel/wiki) pages will remain available.

Anyone wanting to compile their own version should download the `v2.1.8` source zip or use their Git client to checkout the `v2.1.8` tag. All subsequent commits on the `master` branch are for my personal use and contain many breaking changes so
it should be ignored!
